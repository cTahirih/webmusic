            Pharrell Williams and Camila Cabello's collaboration Sangria Wine headlines this week's #NewMusicFriday.C
            Camila has been on a hot streak since her breakthrough single Havana hit Number 1 on the Official Singles Chart, while her self-titled debut album peaked at Number 2.
            By teaming with N.E.R.D's Pharrell, famous for his three million-selling hits Get Lucky, Blurred Lines and Happy, we think the pair have another hit on their hands. Sangria Wine will be performed at the Billboard Music Awards this Sunday (May 20).
            Also on the singles front, Christine and the Queens returns with Girlfriend ft. DƒÅM-FunK, the first taste of her upcoming sophomore album, Jennifer Lopez has a huge collaboration up her sleeve with Dinero ft. Cardi B and DJ Khaled, plus Demi Lovato has two new songs out; she features on Clean Bandit's new single Solo, and she has teamed up with Christina Aguilera for Fall In Line, taken from Xtina's upcoming album Liberation.
            Looking at big albums impacting this week, James Bay will hope to follow-up his Number 1 debut album Chaos and the Calm with another chart topper for Electric Light, and critically-acclaimed Australian artist Courtney Barnett puts out her second solo studio album Tell Me How You Really Feel.
